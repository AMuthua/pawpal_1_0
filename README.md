This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.


Setting up is Easy :- 
    1. Install Flutter SDK and Dart Through Android Studio.
    
    2. Keep checking off the list found by running `flutter doctor`.

 




Copying the pathfile from the explorer is a better idea, as the program may take it as it is.
